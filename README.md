# EcoParali 🌾🌍

Welcome to **EcoParali**! This project aims to provide sustainable solutions for managing agricultural residue, specifically paddy straw, to combat pollution and promote eco-friendly practices for GREEN CREDIT MANAGEMENT. 🚜🌱

## About the Project 🌿

**EcoParali** is developed by the **Paryavaran Pioneers**, a team of four engineering students. The PATENTED project is focused on addressing the real-life problem of stubble burning, which significantly contributes to air pollution.

### Objectives 🎯
- Reduce air pollution caused by stubble burning.
- Provide farmers with sustainable alternatives for residue management.
- Promote the use of agricultural residue for productive purposes.

### Our Approach 🚀
We conducted ground-level surveys and interacted with farmers and gram panchayats to understand the problem deeply and devise practical solutions.

## Features ✨
- **Farmer Portal**: A user-friendly interface for farmers to access information and resources.
- **Residue Management Solutions**: Guidelines and tools for converting agricultural waste into useful products.
- **Real-Time Data**: Monitoring air quality and residue management practices.
